The [DK Bongos](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/DK_Bongo) are special controllers designed for [Donkey Konga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Konga) and [Donkey Kong Jungle Beat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat). Luckily for us, they also can be used as a standard controller on the PC.

For the morbidly curious, here is how to set them up:
1. Plug your DK Bongos into a GameCube USB Adapter.
2. Plug the GameCube USB Adapter into the PC.
3. Download and launch the latest version of [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
4. Select *Options* > *List All Devices*.
5. Select *WUP-028*
6. Click on *Install Driver*.
7. Download and launch the latest version of [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/download).
8. Under *Joystick 2*, bind Buttons 1-4 and 10 to whatever keys you want.
9. Launch your game and have a terrible time.

This is far from the optimal way to play games, especially Team Fortress 2.

But if you insist on trying it with TF2, be sure to enter `+forward` into console.
